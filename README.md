# core-software-engineering
A compendium of resources to learn Core Software Engineering Concepts. I will curate contents
specifically for each of the concepts treated in this repo, but you can go ahead to use
the already available contents provided below.

Mine however is more like a roadmap that contains summaries. I try to help you prevent getting
caught in a resource loop, but also allow you to explore specific concepts deeply if you need to.
