# core-software-engineering
A compendium of resources to learn Core Software Engineering Concepts. I will curate contents
specifically for each of the concepts treated in this repo, but you can go ahead to use
the already available contents provided below.

Mine however is more like a roadmap that contains summaries. I try to help you prevent getting
caught in a resource loop, but also allow you to explore specific concepts deeply if you need to.

## Learn Software Engineering Academically
Learn software engineering from an open-source, academic standpoint using Java
(https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs).

## Learn Distributed Systems
Microservices have seen a wide adoption in the software engineering field. Learn about 
complex distributed systems from the awesome repo (https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems).

## Organization of the Repository
The repo has five subdirectories, each treating different concepts that are applicable to
software engineering:
1. Software-Engineering
2. Distributed-Systems
3. Database-Engineering
4. Infrastructural-Engineering
5. DataStructures-n-Algorithms
